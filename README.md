This contains the report that was made for the project

Project Overview
This project involves the successful design and simulation of a 3-stage inverting BJT amplifier using Multisim, meeting all specified design requirements. The amplifier is built with three stages: Common Emitter (CE), Common Emitter (CE), and Common Collector (CC). The objective was to design and simulate the amplifier such that it achieved the following specifications:

Power Supply: +10 V
Quiescent Current: Maximum of 10 mA
Loaded Voltage: 4 V maximum
No-Load Voltage Gain: 50
This design was rigorously tested using AC and DC analysis to ensure that all parameters were met and the amplifier operated within the required limits. The final schematic and documentation for the project, including all manual calculations and key benchmarks, are included in this repository.

Features
Accurate Design Simulation: The project utilizes both AC and DC analysis to verify all design constraints.
BJT Amplifier Stages: The amplifier consists of three stages, including two common emitter amplifiers and one common collector amplifier.
Design Specifications Met: Achieved a maximum quiescent current of 10 mA, a loaded voltage of 4 V, and a no-load voltage gain of 50.
Power Supply Constraint: The design was developed to operate under a +10 V power supply, ensuring all operating conditions are satisfied.
